# Facial_Recognition_JS_FaceAPI
In this project, we are going to implement facial recognition using JavaScript on the Front-End. Functionalities such as: 
face recognition, drawing facial features, recognizing age and gender,
recognizing facial expressions and, finally, recognizing people's names will be implemented.

All these features will be developed using the FaceAPI.js library
